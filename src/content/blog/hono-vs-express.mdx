# Hono vs Express: Why I Switched to Hono for Backend APIs

After years of using Express.js for building REST APIs, I recently made the switch to Hono. Here's why, and what I've learned along the way.

## What is Hono?

Hono is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the Edges. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, AWS Lambda, and Node.js.

## Performance Comparison

In my benchmarks, Hono consistently outperformed Express:

| Framework | Requests/sec | Latency (avg) |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Hono      | 150,000      | 0.8ms         |
| Express   | 45,000       | 2.5ms         |
| Fastify   | 75,000       | 1.5ms         |

## Why Hono?

### 1. TypeScript First

Hono is built with TypeScript from the ground up:

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/user/:id", (c) => {
  const id = c.req.param("id"); // Fully typed!
  return c.json({ id, name: "Vivek" });
});
```

### 2. Middleware is Simple

```typescript
// Custom middleware
app.use("*", async (c, next) => {
  const start = Date.now();
  await next();
  const ms = Date.now() - start;
  c.header("X-Response-Time", `${ms}ms`);
});
```

### 3. Built-in Validation with Zod

```typescript
import { zValidator } from "@hono/zod-validator";
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
});

app.post("/users", zValidator("json", schema), (c) => {
  const data = c.req.valid("json"); // Typed!
  return c.json(data);
});
```

## Migration Tips

1. Replace `req.body` with `c.req.json()`
2. Replace `res.json()` with `c.json()`
3. Use Hono's built-in CORS and other middleware

## Conclusion

If you're starting a new API project, I highly recommend giving Hono a try. The developer experience is excellent, and the performance gains are real.
